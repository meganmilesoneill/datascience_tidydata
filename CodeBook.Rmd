## Summary
The primary goal of the exercise is to combine and summarize the train and test datasets from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository site here: <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>.

## Raw Data
### The files
The data used in this exercise came in two main sets - train and test - that are broken into three separate files containing feature data, subjects, and labels for a total of 6 files: 

* X_train.txt - training feature data  
* y_train.txt - training label data  
* subject_train.txt - training subject data  
* X_test.txt - test feature data  
* y_test.txt - test label data  
* subject_test.txt - test subject data  

Information about the methods used for gathering and recording the original data are available on the site listed above and in the features_info.txt file.

Two additional files were used to process the data:  

* activity_labels.txt - contains the mapping between the activity code and the activity name  
* features.txt - a list of all the features in the X_train.txt and X_test.txt datasets.  This list also corresponds to the column names in the X_train.txt and X_test.txt files.

## Codebook
* X_train.txt, y_train.txt, subject_train.txt, X_test.txt, y_test.txt, and subject_test.txt were all combined into a single dataframe.
* Column names were generated using the features.txt file.
* A subset of the columns needed for the final data was generated by searching the column names for "mean()" and "std()".  All other columns, with the exception of those pertaining to subject and activity, were excluded.
* Cleanup was performed on the feature column names by stripping dashes ("-"), commas (","), and parentheses("()").
* The final summary data was created by aggregating the data by "subject" and "activity.name" using the "mean" function.
